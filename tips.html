        <div class="flex-container">
            <p> The right to protest is a fundamental right protected by the US Constitution and the First Amendment,
                but
                there are risks in participating in these events, especially for Black and Brown people. This page
                compiles
                information on what people should keep in mind in order to protect themselves and others while
                protesting.

        <h2> How to protect yourself and others while protesting </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <ul class="box">
                <li> Do not run. Avoid running to close a gap or move away unless absolutely necessary. Move slowly
                    as a
                    group.
                </li>
                <li>Use ONLY water to treat pepper spray.</li>
                <li> Protect your cell phone privacy. Lock your phone, turn off thumb and/or face unlock, disable
                    location
                    services on all your apps, turn off notifications on your home screen, disable Siri/Alexa, and
                    leave
                    your phone locked when taking photos and videos.
                </li>
                <li> Protect your identity and the identity of others. Do not post pictures of people’s faces on
                    social
                    media. If you do post pictures, make sure faces are covered or obscured and you do not post
                    until
                    you
                    are home.
                </li>
                <li> Be aware that undercover police may be in the crowd. Be wary of individuals who forcefully
                    advocate
                    for
                    violence, especially when the crowd or organizers seem peaceful, or try to encourage others to
                    join
                    them
                    in violent action. Don’t engage with them unless absolutely necessary. Undercover officers often
                    wear
                    colored armbands to identify themselves to their colleagues (the color varies from day to day
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are protesting after curfew, there is an increased risk of arrest or bodily injury. There
                    is
                    also
                    safety in numbers. The NYPD has been using “kettling” tactics to surround protesters at
                    intersections or
                    in parks shortly before or during curfew, then charging at the crowd and arresting demonstrators
                    en
                    masse once the curfew is in effect. If you are in a “kettle,” stay calm. If police let you
                    through,
                    avoid running and walk to safety, ideally in a group.

        <h2> Interacting with the police </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <ul class="box">
                <li> Avoid direct police contact. Whenever possible, avoid contact with police, military, or
                    counter-protestors. Follow instructions from event organizers about where to protest and when to
                    move.
                </li>
                <li> You have a constitutional right to demonstrate. If curfew is in effect, police can issue an
                    order
                    to
                    “disperse” (go home) and may give you time to comply. Failing to comply with a dispersal order
                    is a
                    Class B misdemeanor in New York, which can carry a maximum penalty of up to three months’
                    imprisonment
                    or one year’s probation.
                </li>
                <li> If you are stopped, ask if you are free to go. If the police say yes, calmly walk away.
                </li>
                <li> You have the right to record as part of your right to protest. However, the police can order
                    people
                    to
                    stop interfering with legitimate police operations. Video recording from a safe distance is not
                    interfering.
                </li>
                <li> If you are stopped, police cannot take or confiscate any videos or photos without a warrant. In
                    some
                    states, audio is treated differently than images, but images and video images are always
                    protected
                    by
                    the First Amendment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are arrested, do not say anything. Ask for a lawyer immediately. Do not sign anything and
                    do
                    not
                    agree to anything without an attorney present. Demand your right to a local phone call to call a
                    lawyer
                    or your local National Lawyer's Guild (NLG) chapter, and give them the date, time and location
                    of
                    your
                    arrest. If you call a lawyer for legal advice, law enforcement is not allowed to listen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are taken for processing or detention, give only your name and ID with current address.
                    Police
                    can take your fingerprints, but you are not required to submit to an iris scan. Do not consent
                    to
                    searches, including searches of devices, or a DNA swab. Don’t accept cigarettes, gum, or a drink
                    as
                    they
                    can easily be swabbed for DNA later. If you are a noncitizen, do not disclose your immigration
                    or
                    visa
                    status to anyone except your attorney. If you are trans or gender nonconforming, you have a
                    right to
                    be
                    held in the cell of your choice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Police are never allowed to delete data from your device.
                </li>
                <li> If you witness someone being arrested, ask their name and date of birth and write it down as
                    soon
                    as
                    possible. </li>

        <h2> What to wear and bring </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <ul class="box">
                <li> Wear nondescript clothing and comfortable shoes. And cover identifying tattoos. Tie up long
                    hair
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a friend. Make sure you arrive together and leave together.
                </li>
                <li> Bring water. At least two bottles per person. Make sure you are hydrated and bring or conserve
                    enough
                    to flush the affected area if you are targeted with pepper spray or pepper bullets.
                </li>
                <li> If possible, do not wear eye makeup or contacts, in case you are targeted with pepper spray or
                    pepper
                    bullets. Contacts especially pose a very high risk of permanent eye damage if you are pepper
                    sprayed
                    while wearing them.
                </li>
                <li> Bring a hat and/or sunscreen. Avoid oil-based creams that can trap chemicals.
                </li>
                <li> Bring a pocket Know Your Rights guide. </li>
                <li>Don’t bring anything you wouldn’t want to get arrested with (e.g., weapons, illegal substances,
                    valuables, etc.).</li>
                <li>Small snacks. But avoid sharing them (same goes for drinks).</li>
                <li>Any medications you need in case of arrest.

        <h2> Other reminders </h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <ul class="box">
                <li> Have a trusted friend who is not at the protest who can make sure you left the protest safely.
                    Make
                    sure they know your full legal name and date of birth.
                </li>
                <li> Be mindful of press interactions. Do not talk to the media. If a member of the press approaches
                    you,
                    direct them to an event organizer first.
                </li>
                <li> Mental health resources are available. Events at protests and mass mobilizations can lead to
                    critical
                    incident stress on top of the pandemic and economic insecurities.
                </li>
                <li> Do not attend any gatherings if you feel ill.
